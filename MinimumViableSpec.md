# Minimum Viable Specification

# Summary

_What is the thing we are describing? This should be a short summmary of 100 words or fewer._

# Why we should do it

_Provide a clear reason for taking on this project. Typically, this will take the form of a solution to a use case._

## Assumptions
_Enumerate some of the assumptions driving this project._

1. List a few assumptions that led us here

2. Add a few more assumptions, but not too many

# Goal
_What metrics are we using to measure this project? Think "X to Y by when" to quantify a metric._

Here are a few metrics that will define success in this project. A goal listed here might be an intermediate or a final goal.

## Outputs
_List the business outcomes that reaching a metric would achieve_

1. These are a few outcomes we want to achieve

2. And a few more...

## Benefit
_List the benefits that this project hopes to acheive_

* These are the stated benefits of our outcomes

* And a few more...

# How will we do it
_This is a list of actions toward the goal. Be concrete and specific_

Here is our best-effort description of how we will do this thing as of [todayâ€™s date]

## What could go wrong
_Take a minute to think about what can (and will) go wrong._

* These are a few potential risks to our approach

* And a few more...

## Open Questions

* What questions have we not asked yet?

* Who or what will make this team stronger or this project more successful?


## Metrics
_Metrics should state an item that will change from x value to y value by a date. Metric descriptions might also include a lower bound, and upper bound, and instructions for what to do when either a lower or upper bound is breached_

We will measure our progress with these metrics:

1. Metric x, checked on y date, with method z

2. Metric x, checked on y date, with method z

## Time, Cost, and Effort
_Take your best guess at estimating the time, cost, and effort._

How much time will it take, what will it cost, and how are you estimating this effort?

# Discussion
_This is a placeholder for meeting notes and discussion._

A place for us to put our notes about the discussions we have on this project.

# Parking Lot
_If an item is not relevant to the current discussion but might be interesting later, add it here._

A place for us to list all of the great ideas we get that are not immediately relevant to this project.
